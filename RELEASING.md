# Release Process

This document outlines the release process for the Codex ZSH Plugin.

## Semantic Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** version (x.0.0) for incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR** version (x.y.0) for functionality added in a backwards compatible manner.
- **PATCH** version (x.y.z) for backwards compatible bug fixes.

## Release Testing Checklist

Before every release, ensure the following:

- [ ] Manual verification of plugin loading in a clean ZSH environment.
- [ ] Verify `codex` completions are working as expected.
- [ ] Check for any `TODO` comments that should be addressed.
- [ ] Ensure `README.md` is up to date.
- [ ] Verify that the version in `VERSION` and `codex.plugin.zsh` match.

## Release Procedure

1.  **Prepare the release:**
    Ensure you are on the `main` branch and it is up to date.
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    ```

2.  **Run the release script:**
    Use the provided release script to bump the version and create a tag.
    ```bash
    ./tools/release.sh [patch|minor|major]
    ```
    This script will:
    - Update the `VERSION` file.
    - Update the version comment in `codex.plugin.zsh`.
    - Commit the changes.
    - Create a git tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`).

3.  **Push the changes and tag:**
    ```bash
    git push origin main --tags
    ```

4.  **GitHub Release:**
    Once the tag is pushed, a GitHub Action will automatically:
    - Create a new GitHub Release.
    - Generate release notes based on the commits since the last release.

## Automated Changelog

The release notes are automatically generated by GitHub during the release process. For best results, use descriptive commit messages or pull request titles.
