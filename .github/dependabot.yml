# Note: This project is a ZSH shell plugin with no external package manager
# dependencies. Dependabot configuration is set up and ready for when
# dependencies are added (e.g., if GitHub Actions, Docker, or npm dependencies
# are introduced). Currently, no ecosystems require monitoring.
#
# To enable an ecosystem:
# 1. Uncomment the corresponding section above
# 2. Commit and push changes
# 3. GitHub will automatically enable Dependabot for that ecosystem
